# CURRENT HANDOFF

## Project
Lagu Full Album — `inoriko920-dev/Full-Album-Lagu`

## Current position
STEP 10 is complete. W11-01 is COMPLETE / PASS. **W11-02 is IN PROGRESS; T11-W02-01..05 are COMPLETE / PASS, and T11-W02-06 is READY.** STEP 11 remains in progress overall.

## Mandatory read order
AGENTS -> PROJECT_STATE -> source-of-truth INDEX -> current planning DOCX -> Final UI Reference/UI Freeze -> STEP 06 Architecture -> STEP 07 Code Constitution -> STEP 10 SLC report -> STEP 11 Feature Registry/Dependency Graph/Wave Charter -> TASKS.

## Active wave
**W11-02 Media Intake Foundation**
- Planning: ASTRA COMPLETE / PASS; DoR PASS.
- Features: FTR-003 + FTR-016 + FTR-018 cross-cut.
- T11-W02-01..05: COMPLETE / PASS / VERIFIED.
- T11-W02-05 verified implementation head: `28c9fe1f1581482a4440ff894532d34f0b0f0a4c`.
- Windows CI: `37607158798` PASS; job `112745333468`.
- Evidence: `docs/step11/evidence/T11_W02_05_FROZEN_MEDIA_RELINK_UI_EVIDENCE.md`.
- Media import now exposes selecting/discovery/probe/commit/cancel/error states inside the approved frozen Media hierarchy.
- Imported tracks appear conditionally in Media and Album Timeline without changing the empty SCR-002A state.
- Required missing audio exposes UI-IMG-002F warning and blocks Render readiness; optional missing visual remains non-blocking.
- DLG-005 unresolved/partial relink states are wired to typed single/folder relink actions and preserve ambiguous/no-match outcomes.
- Renderer remains filesystem/dialog/subprocess/provider-free.
- Permanent Gemini rail and frozen global hierarchy remain unchanged.
- Exact default SCR-002A frozen visual baseline PASS; visual artifact `11475113563`.
- T11-W02-06 owns final wave acceptance, drift review and evidence closure; it has not started yet.

## Next exact task
**T11-W02-06 Wave E2E, Drift Review & Evidence Closure** — SOL only.

Execute the final W11-02 acceptance matrix/E2E verification, architecture/UI/trust-boundary drift review, and evidence consolidation. Close W11-02 only if every required criterion passes. Do not start W11-03 in the same turn.

## Protected boundaries
Renderer cannot receive direct filesystem/dialog/provider/subprocess access. Media intake/relink filesystem ownership belongs to Electron main behind typed preload/IPC. Source media must remain non-destructive. Recovery artifacts remain separate from primary Save. Frozen UI cannot be silently redesigned. Gemini and exact FFmpeg/FFprobe concrete integrations remain STEP 12 owned.
